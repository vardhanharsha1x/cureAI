## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) for a calm and trustworthy feel. The hue evokes a sense of tranquility and reassurance, commonly associated with healthcare environments.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean and modern look, remaining unobtrusive and visually 'quiet.'
- Accent color: Mint green (#BDECB6) to highlight important information and interactive elements. Being approximately 30 degrees from blue on the color wheel, this creates a subtle contrast for emphasis, without disrupting the calming color scheme.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, geometric, clean, and readable interface. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Bento grid style to present the information in a structured and visually appealing manner.
- Use bold text for main headings and underlined text for side headings to provide clear visual hierarchy.
